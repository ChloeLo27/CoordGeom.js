# CoordGeom.js

A JavaScript framework developed for coordinate geometry calculation with vectors.

## CAUTION

-   **WARNING**: This library **DOES NOT** handle float point error.  Please bare this in mind.
-   when constructing new polygon, please check whether the points really form one before setting up the new object.
-   all points passed to new _polygon_, new _line segment_ and new _circle_ will be cloned, therefore de-referenced.  So any changes made to the point forming the algebraic object will not affect the already created object.
