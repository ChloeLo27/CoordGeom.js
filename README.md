# CoordGeom.js
A JavaScript framework developed for coordinate geometry calculation with vectors.

## Note
Please note that this framework is still under construction.

## Capabilities
This framework currently covers the following objects:
- point
- line
- vector
- line segment

Also the following cross object functions:
- intercept of two lines
- line from point and slope
- line from two points
- translate point by vector
- vector from two points
- reflect point in line
